## 📋 What You'll Need (Shopping List)

### Required Hardware (Buy These First)

1. **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** - 4GB or 8GB RAM
   - **Where to buy:** Amazon, Best Buy, MicroCenter, official Pi retailers
   - **Price:** ~$75-95 USD
   - **Why this model:** Older Pi models are too slow for file encryption

2. **Official Raspberry Pi Power Supply** - USB-C, 5V 3A
   - **Where to buy:** Same places as Pi
   - **Price:** ~$10-15 USD
   - **⚠️ Important:** Generic chargers often cause problems

3. **MicroSD Card** - 64GB, Class 10 or better (SanDisk or Samsung recommended)
   - **Where to buy:** Any electronics store

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Critical Issues (Server Won't Start)

#### "FATAL: External USB storage not available"
**Symptoms:** Server starts but immediately fails with USB storage error
```
FATAL: External USB storage not available
Reason: No USB drive mounted
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Check if USB drive is connected:**
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   Look for your USB drive (usually `sda`, `sdb`, etc.)

2. **If USB drive shows but not mounted:**
   ```bash
   sudo bash setup/setup-usb-storage.sh
   ```

3. **If USB drive is mounted elsewhere (like `/media/`):**
   ```bash
   # Unmount from current location
   sudo umount /media/siesgst/New\ Volume
   # Or find the exact mount point:
   df -h | grep sda
   sudo umount /dev/sda1
   
   # Run setup script
   sudo bash setup/setup-usb-storage.sh
   ```

4. **Manual USB setup if script fails:**
   ```bash
   # Create mount point
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/pocketcloud
   
   # Format drive (DESTROYS DATA!)
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
   
   # Mount it
   sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/pocketcloud
   
   # Set permissions
   sudo chown $USER:$USER /mnt/pocketcloud
   
   # Add to auto-mount
   echo "/dev/sda1 /mnt/pocketcloud ext4 defaults 0 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```

#### "stats is not defined" Error
**Symptoms:** Dashboard loads but shows template errors
```
stats is not defined
Server error: /views/dashboard.ejs:193
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update to latest version
cd ~/Desktop/Pocketcloud
git pull origin master
npm start
```

#### "getSystemIdentity is not a function"
**Symptoms:** Security page crashes
```
TypeError: getSystemIdentity is not a function
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update to latest version with fixes
cd ~/Desktop/Pocketcloud
git pull origin master
npm start
```

### USB Drive Issues

#### "Device is busy" During Setup
**Symptoms:** Setup script fails with "Partition(s) on /dev/sda are being used"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's using the drive
sudo lsof /dev/sda1

# Unmount all partitions
sudo umount /dev/sda1
sudo umount /dev/sda2
# Or unmount by mount point
sudo umount /media/siesgst/New\ Volume

# Run setup again
sudo bash setup/setup-usb-storage.sh
```

#### USB Drive Disconnects During Use
**Symptoms:** I/O errors, "Storage failure detected"
```
Dashboard error: EIO: i/o error, mkdir '/mnt/pocketcloud/user_1'
Storage failure detected: USB drive disconnected
```

**What happens now:** PocketCloud shows a friendly "Storage Disconnected" page instead of crashing

**Solutions:**
1. **Reconnect USB drive** - Page will auto-detect and redirect
2. **Check USB connection** - Ensure cable is secure
3. **Check power supply** - Weak power can cause disconnections
4. **Use powered USB hub** - For high-power drives

#### "Mount point not writable"
**Symptoms:** USB mounted but permission errors
```
FATAL: External USB storage not available
Reason: Mount point not writable
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /mnt/pocketcloud
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/pocketcloud

# Test write access
touch /mnt/pocketcloud/test-file
rm /mnt/pocketcloud/test-file
```

### Network Access Issues

#### "Can't access PocketCloud from my phone"
1. **Check if Pi and phone are on same Wi-Fi network**
2. **Find Pi's IP address:**
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```
3. **Try the Pi's IP address:** `http://192.168.1.XXX:3000`
4. **Check firewall:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   # If needed:
   sudo ufw allow 3000
   ```

### Service Issues

#### "PocketCloud won't start"
1. **Check service status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status pocketcloud
   ```

2. **Check detailed logs:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u pocketcloud -n 50
   ```

3. **Common fixes:**
   ```bash
   # Restart service
   sudo systemctl restart pocketcloud
   
   # If service doesn't exist, install it:
   sudo bash setup/install.sh
   ```

#### "Port 3000 already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 3000

# Kill the process or use different port
PORT=8080 npm start
```

### Git/Update Issues

#### "Git pull fails" or "Repository not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check remote URL
git remote -v

# Fix remote URL if needed
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/HarshDev-byte/Pocketcloud.git

# Pull updates
git pull origin master
```

### Data Issues

#### "Forgot my password"
1. **⚠️ There's no password recovery** (by design for security)
2. **You'll need to create a new account**
3. **Your old files will remain encrypted and inaccessible**

#### "Files won't upload"
1. **Check disk space:**
   ```bash
   df -h | grep pocketcloud
   ```
2. **Check file size** (default limit: 1GB)
3. **Check file type** (only certain types allowed)

### Hardware Issues

#### "Pi won't boot"
1. **Check power supply** (red LED should be solid)
2. **Check SD card** (re-flash if necessary)
3. **Try different HDMI cable/monitor**

#### "USB drive not detected"
1. **Try different USB port**
2. **Check USB cable**
3. **Try different USB drive**
4. **Check power supply** (Pi needs enough power for USB devices)

### Performance Issues

#### "Slow file uploads/downloads"
1. **Use USB 3.0 drive** (blue connector)
2. **Connect to USB 3.0 port** (blue port on Pi 4)
3. **Check network speed** for remote access
4. **Use wired connection** instead of Wi-Fi when possible

### Recovery Procedures

#### "Complete reset" (if everything is broken)
```bash
# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop pocketcloud

# Remove installation
sudo rm -rf /opt/pocketcloud
sudo userdel pocketcloud

# Re-run setup
cd ~/Desktop/Pocketcloud
sudo bash setup/install.sh
```

#### "USB drive corrupted"
```bash
# Check filesystem

## 🔒 Security Notes

### What PocketCloud Does
- **Encrypts all files** with AES-256-GCM (military-grade)
- **Never stores your password** (uses it to encrypt/decrypt)
- **Works completely offline** (no internet required after setup)
- **Stores everything on your USB drive** (not the SD card)

### What You Should Do
- **Use a strong password** (mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
- **Keep your Pi physically secure** (locked room/cabinet)
- **Make regular backups:** `sudo bash tools/backup-pocketcloud.sh`
- **Only access from trusted devices** on your home network

### What PocketCloud Doesn't Do
- **No cloud sync** (everything stays on your Pi)
- **No password recovery** (if you forget it, files are gone)
- **No remote access** (only works on your local network)
- **No automatic backups** (you must create them manually)
